# Landmark detection using face_recognition library (A wrapper on well-known dlib library for face recognition)

This project is part of an assignment for the coursework Applied machine learning in Durham college-AIDI 2000.

Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the face recognition library.

It uses dlib library's prerained model under the hood Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!
